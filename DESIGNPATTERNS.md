- design pattern is a solution to a problem in a context
- important aspects of patterns: recurring problem, reusable solution, and name
- patterns are discovered, not created
- principles - low level knowledge
- patterns - high level knowledge
- you should learn patterns because game rules are not enough
- patterns capture expert knowledge
- inheritance is not always the best solution
- study and know principles well
- behavioral patterns you should know: strategy and state, command, observer, template method
- abstract methods are required and steps that must be customized
- hooks are optional and an abstract class may provide a default implementation
- things to remember: how objects should communicate and their responsibilities
- creational patterns to know: singleton, factory and abstract factory, and builder
- singleton patterns have a private constructor and have only one instance
- types of factories: simple factory, actory method, abstract factory
- singleton ensures a class only has one instance, providing a global point of access
- factory method allows subclasses decide which class to instantiate
- abstract factory creates hierarchies or families of related objects
- builder can separate the construction of an object from its representation
- structural patterns to know: facade, decorator, adapter, and proxy
- facade pattern provides a simplified interface to use subsystem classes, can provide additional functionality, and decouples a client from the subsystem
- common uses of a proxy: remote calls, security, cache, and virtual
- proxy is related to facade and decorator
- facade simplifies an interface to a subsystem, decoupling a client from it
- decorator attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically
- adapter converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect
- proxy provides a surrogate for another object to control access to it
